When adding a new WHATWG standard, these are the things that need to be done:

1. Create a logo.
1. Identify a shortname that is used for the spec.whatwg.org subdomain and repository (for tooling it is important that these are named identically).
   1. Ensure the subdomain works.
   1. Ensure there is repository.
1. Create a Twitter account.
1. Add it to https://github.com/whatwg/sg/blob/main/db.json and ensure the relevant details are filled in. (In case there's a new Workstream more updates will be needed.)
1. Run https://github.com/whatwg/spec-factory.
1. Run `labels.py`.
1. Draw the rest of the fucking owl.
